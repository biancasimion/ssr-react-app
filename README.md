# ssr-react-app
Server side rendering React app with Node.js and Express.
I am using webpack and babel.
I separated the app in two parts src/server and src/clinet.
I created a component for the Hero and one for the Story. 

## How to run
1. execute `run npm i`
2. `npm run dev-start` to start the app
